# K-Means Clustering


This is a simple, however effective unsupervised clustering algorithm.  
It attempts to partition the dataset into K pre-defined clusters where each data point belongs to only one group.

There are three steps

1. Initialisation
2. Calculate distance and assignment
3. Move the centres
