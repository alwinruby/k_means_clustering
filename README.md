# K-Means Clustering


This is a simple, however effective unsupervised clustering algorithm.  
It attempts to partition the dataset into K pre-defined clusters where each data point belongs to only one group.

There are three steps

1. Initialisation
2. Calculate distance and assignment
3. Move the centres 


To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids

It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:

    The centroids have stabilized â€” there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.

    The defined number of iterations has been achieved.

In general.

    Step 1: Import libraries
    Step 2: Generate random data
    Step 3: Use Scikit-Learn
    Step 4: Finding the centroid
    Step 5: Testing the algorithm

K-means clustering is an extensively used technique for data cluster analysis.
